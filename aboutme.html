    <h2>Pride and Prejudice </h2>
    <p>
        The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, 
        the dynamic protagonist of the book who learns about the repercussions 
        of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial
        goodness and actual goodness.
